CoreLab App Challenge
This project showcases the use of flutter_modular in conjunction with the Clean Architecture pattern. It also utilizes shared_preferences for persisting search data. We hope you find it informative and useful.

Overview
This Flutter project demonstrates the implementation of a modular architecture using flutter_modular while adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture. The project includes features for searching and displaying products, along with history tracking using shared preferences.

Features
Modular Architecture: The project follows a modular architecture pattern using flutter_modular, promoting code organization and maintainability.

Clean Architecture: The application architecture is designed based on the Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns and improving testability, scalability, and maintainability.

Search Functionality: The app allows users to search for products, with the search results updating dynamically as users type.

Search History: Search history is tracked and stored using shared_preferences, providing users with a convenient way to revisit previous searches.
